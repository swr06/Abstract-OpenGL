# Abstract-OpenGL
This is just a project that abstracts the main modern OpenGL functions into classes.
Since OpenGL is state machine, it makes it a little tedious to generate, bind and unbind modern OpenGL objects. 
So this library abstracts the whole thing into classes which makes it easier to dive in and write modern OpenGL code.

# Dependencies
I used GLFW for windowing and GLEW to access modern OpenGL functions.
